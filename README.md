# NA-MEMD for Python


## Introdction
Python implementation of Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (NA-MEMD). Includes functions for noise generation, multivariate empirical mode breakdown (MEMD).  
  
Offers additional options for noise generation, and allows for n-dimensional NA-MEMD as opposed to the previous bivariate option [1].


## Dependencies 
- NumPy
- SciPy  
- to be updated  

```bash
pip install numpy 
```


## Functions and Usage  
to be updated
```python
#print("This is a check")
#print("update 2")
```
